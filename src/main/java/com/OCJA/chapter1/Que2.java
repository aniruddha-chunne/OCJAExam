    2. The following class diagram demonstrates the relationship
        between Gold and Silver, which extend the Metal class. Assume
    the attributes are all declared public. Which statement about the
    diagram is not true?
    A. The diagram demonstrates platform independence in Java.
    B. The diagram demonstrates object-oriented design in Java.
    C. The Gold and Silver classes inherit weight and color
    attributes from the Metal class.
    D. Gold does not inherit the luster attribute.

    Ans:-

    2. A. The diagram is an example of object-oriented design in Java,
    making Option B a true statement. Options C and D are also
    true, as they follow from the inheritance model in the diagram.
    Option A is the correct answer, since platform independence has
    nothing to do with the diagram.
