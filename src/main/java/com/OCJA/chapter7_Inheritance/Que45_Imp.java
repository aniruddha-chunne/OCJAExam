 * 45. Fill in the blanks: ____________methods must have a
 * different list of parameters, while ____________methods
 * must have the exact same return type.
 * A. Overloaded, overridden
 * B. Inherited, overridden
 * C. Overridden, overloaded
 * D. None of the above
 *
 *
 * 45. D. Trick question! Option A seems like the correct answer, but
 * the second part of the sentence is false, regardless of whether
 * you insert overloaded or overridden. Overridden methods must
 * have covariant return types, which may not be exactly the same
 * as the type in the parent class. Therefore, Option D is the correct
 * answer.
