  ***   27. What is the result of running the following as java Copier?
        package duplicate;
        public class Copier
        {

             public static void main(String... original)
             {

                String... copy = original;
                System.out.println(copy.length + " " + copy[0]);

             }

        }
        A. 0
        B. 0 followed by an exception
        C. 1 followed by an exception
        D. The code does not compile.

        27. D. Three dots in a row is a varargs parameter. While varargs is
        used like an array from within the method, it can only be used as
        a method parameter. This syntax is not allowed for a variable,
        making Option D the answer.
