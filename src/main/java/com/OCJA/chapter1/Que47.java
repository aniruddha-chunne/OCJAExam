        47. Which statements about calling the compilation command javac
        and the execution command java are true?

        I. java may use a period . to separate packages.
        II. javac takes a .java file and returns a .class file.
        III. java may use a slash (/) to separate packages.

        A. I only
        B. II only
        C. I and II
        D. I, II, and III

        47. C. The javac command takes a text-based .java file and returns
        a binary bytecode .class file, making II a true statement. The
        java command uses a period (.) to separate packages, not a
        slash (/), making I a true statement and III a false statement.
        For these reasons, Option C is the correct answer.
