 * 25. Which of the following statements is correct?
 * A. A reference to a class can be assigned to a subclass
 * reference without an explicit cast.
 * B. A reference to a class can be assigned to a superclass
 * reference without an explicit cast.
 * C. A reference to an interface can be assigned to a reference of
 * a class that implements the interface without an explicit
 * cast.
 * D. A reference to a class that implements an interface can be
 * assigned to an interface reference only with an explicit cast.
 *
 * B
 *
 * 25. B. A reference to a class can be implicitly assigned to a
 * superclass reference without an explicit class, making Option B
 * the correct answer. Assigning a reference to a subclass, though,
 * requires an explicit cast, making Option A incorrect. Option C is
 * also incorrect because an interface does not inherit from a class.
 * A reference to an interface requires an explicit cast to be
 * assigned to a reference of any class, even one that implements
 * the interface. An interface reference requires an explicit cast to
 * be assigned to a class reference. Finally, Option D is incorrect.
 * An explicit cast is not required to assign a reference to a class
 * that implements an interface to a reference of the interface.
