 *
 * 6. Imagine you are working with another team to build an
 * application. You are developing code that uses a class that the
 * other team has not finished writing yet. Which element of Java
 * would best facilitate this development, allowing easy integration
 * once the other team’s code is complete?
 * A. An abstract class
 * B. An interface
 * C. static methods
 * D. An access modifier
 *
 * B
 *
 * 6. B. The key here is understanding which of these features of Java
 * allow one developer to build their application around another
 * developer’s code, even if that code is not ready yet. For this
 * problem, an interface is the best choice. If the two teams agree
 * on a common interface, one developer can write code that uses
 * the interface, while another developer writes code that
 * implements the interface. Assuming neither team changes the
 * interface, the code can be easily integrated once both teams are
 * done. For these reasons, Option B is the correct answer.
