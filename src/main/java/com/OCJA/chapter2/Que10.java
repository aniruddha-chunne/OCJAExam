        10. Which best describes what the new keyword does?
        A. Creates a copy of an existing object and treats it as a new one
        B. Creates a new primitive
        C. Instantiates a new object
        D. Switches an object reference to a new one

        10. C. The new keyword is used to call the constructor for a class and
        instantiate an instance of the class. A primitive cannot be
        created using the new keyword. Dealing with references happens
        after the object created by new is returned.
