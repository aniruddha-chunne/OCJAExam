    16. Given that the current directory is /user/home, with an
    application Java file in /user/home/Manager.java that uses the
    default package, which are the correct commands to compile
    and run the application in Java?

    A. javac Manager
    java Manager

    B. javac Manager.java
    java Manager

    C. javac Manager
    java Manager.class

    D. javac Manager.java
    java Manager.class


    16. B. The compilation command requires the full or relative name
    of the file, including the .java extension, making Options A and
    C incorrect. The execution command requires the class name
    without a filename extension, making Option D incorrect.
    Option B is the only correct set of compilation and execution
    commands.
