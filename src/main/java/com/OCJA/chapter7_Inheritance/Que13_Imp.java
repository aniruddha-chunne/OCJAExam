 * 13. Which modifier can be applied to an interface method?
 * A. protected
 * B. static
 * C. private
 * D. final
 *
 *
 *
 * 13. B. Interface methods are implicitly public, making Option A and
 * C incorrect. Interface methods can also not be declared final,
 * whether they are static, default, or abstract methods, making
 * Option D incorrect. Option B is the correct answer because an
 * interface method can be declared static.
