        1. Which of the following declarations does not compile?
            A. double num1, int num2 = 0;
            B. int num1, num2;
            C. int num1, num2 = 0;
            D. int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;

        1. A. Option A does not compile because Java does not allow
            declaring different types as part of the same declaration. The
            other three options show various legal combinations of
            combining multiple variables in the same declarations with
            optional default values.
