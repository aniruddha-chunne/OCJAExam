8. Which statement about ternary expressions is true?
A. In some cases, both expressions to the right of the
conditional operator in a ternary expression will be
evaluated at runtime.
B. Ternary expressions require parentheses for proper
evaluation.
C. The ternary expressions are a convenient replacement for
an if-then-else statement.
D. Ternary expressions support int and boolean expressions
for the left-most operand.

8. C. Option A is incorrect as only one of the two right-hand
expressions is evaluated at runtime. Parentheses are often
helpful for reading ternary expressions but are not required,
making Option B incorrect. Option C is a correct statement
about ternary operators as they are commonly used to replace
short if-then-else statements. Finally, Option D is incorrect as
only boolean expressions are permitted in the left-most operand
of a ternary expression.
