 * 11. What does the following code output?
 * int singer = 0;
 * while (singer)
 *  System.out.println(singer++);
 * A. 0
 * B. The code does not compile.
 * C. The loops complete with no output.
 * D. This is an infinite loop.
 *
 * 11. B. A while loop requires a boolean condition. While singer is a
