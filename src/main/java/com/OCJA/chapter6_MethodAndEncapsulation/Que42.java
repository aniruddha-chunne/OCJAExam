 *
 * 42. Which statement about a static variable is true?
 * A. The value of a static variable must be set when the variable
 * is declared or in a static initialization block.
 * B. It is not possible to read static final variables outside the
 * class in which they are defined.
 * C. It is not possible to reference static methods using static
 * imports.
 * D. A static variable is always available in all instances of the
 * class.
 *
 * 42. D. Option A is a statement about final static variables, not all
 * static variables. Option B only applies to static variables
 * marked private, not final. Option C is false because static
 * imports can be used to reference both variables and methods.
 * Option D is the correct answer because a static variable is
 * accessible to all instances of the class.
