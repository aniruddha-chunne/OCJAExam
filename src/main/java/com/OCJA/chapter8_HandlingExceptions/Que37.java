 * 37. Which of the following is the best scenario to use an exception?
 * A. The computer caught fire.
 * B. The code does not compile.
 * C. A caller passes invalid data to a method.
 * D. A method finishes sooner than expected.
 *
 * C
 *
 * 37. C. Option A is incorrect. You should probably seek help if the
 * computer is on fire! Option B is incorrect because code that does
 * not compile cannot run and therefore cannot throw any
 * exceptions. Option C is the best answer, since an
 * IllegalArgumentException can be used to alert a caller of missing
 * or invalid data. Option D is incorrect; finishing sooner is rarely
 * considered a problem.
