 // 532 - Answer

    20. Which type can fill in the blank?
        _______ pi = 3.14;
        A. byte
        B. float
        C. double
        D. short

        20. C. Options A and D are incorrect because byte and short do not
            store values with decimal points. Option B is tempting.
            However, 3.14 is automatically a double. It requires casting to
            float or writing 3.14f in order to be assigned to a float.
            Therefore, Option C is correct
