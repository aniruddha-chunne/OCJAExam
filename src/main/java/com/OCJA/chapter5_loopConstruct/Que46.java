 * 46. Which of the following iterates a different number of times than
 * the others?
 * A. for (int k=0; k < 5; k++) {}
 * B. for (int k=1; k <= 5; k++) {}
 * C. int k=0; do { } while(k++ < 5)
 * D. int k=0; while (k++ < 5) {}
 *
 * 46. C. Option A goes through five indexes on the iterations: 0, 1, 2, 3
 * and 4. Option B also goes through five indexes: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 * Option D goes through five iterations as well, from 0 to 4.
 * However, Option C goes through six iterations since the loop
 * condition is at the end of the loop. Therefore it is not like the
 * others, and Option C is the answer.
