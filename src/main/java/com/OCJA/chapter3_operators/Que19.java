19. Given the following code snippet, what is the value of dinner
after it is executed?
int time = 11;
int day = 4;
String dinner = time > 10 ? day ? "Takeout" : "Salad" :
"Leftovers";
A. Takeout
B. Salad
C. The code does not compile but would compile if
parentheses were added.
D. None of the above

19. D. While parentheses are recommended for ternary operations,
especially embedded ones, they are not required, so Option C is
incorrect. The code does not compile because day is an int, not a
boolean expression, in the second ternary operation, making
Option D the correct answer. Remember that in Java, numeric
values are not accepted in place of boolean expressions in if-then
statements or ternary operations.
