43. Fill in the blanks: The______________ operator is true if
either of the operands are true, while the______________
operator flips a boolean value.
A. +, -
B. &&, !
C. |, -
D. ||, !

D. The conditional disjunction (OR) || operator is true if either
of the operands are true, while the logical complement (!)
operator reverses or flips a boolean value, making Option D the
correct answer. The other options use operators that do not
match this description. In particular, Options A and C include
operators that can only be applied to numerical values, not
boolean ones.
