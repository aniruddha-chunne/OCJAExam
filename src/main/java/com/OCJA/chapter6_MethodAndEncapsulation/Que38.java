 *
 * 38. Fill in the blanks: The ____________access modifier allows
 *  * access to everything the ____________access modifier does
 *  * and more.
 *  * A. public, private
 *  * B. private, package-private
 *  * C. package-private, protected
 *  * D. private, public
 *  *
 *  * 38. A. The public modifier allows access to members in the same
 * class, package, subclass, or even classes in other packages, while
 * the private modifier allows access only to members in the same
 * class. Therefore, the public access modifier allows access to
 * everything the private access modifier does, and more, making
 * Option A the correct answer. Options B, C, and D are incorrect
 * because the first term is a more restrictive access modifier than
 * the second term
