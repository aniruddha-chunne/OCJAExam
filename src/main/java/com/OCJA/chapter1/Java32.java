32. Given the following code, what values inserted in order into the
        blank lines, allow the code to compile?

                    _______agent;
                    public _______Banker {
                    private static _______getMaxWithdrawal() {
                    return 10;
                    }
                    }

                A. import, class, null
                B. import, interface, void
                C. package, int, int
                D. package, class, long

                
                32. D. Option A is incorrect as the return type of the method cannot
                be null. Option B is also incorrect as the return type cannot be
                void if the method uses a return statement. Option C is incorrect
                too as the class keyword is replaced with int. Option D is
                correct because itâ€™s the only answer that allows the code to
                compile without issue. Note that other values are possible for
                this question. For example, either int or long can be entered in
                the last blank. The key here is that only one of the available
                answer choices allows the code to compil
