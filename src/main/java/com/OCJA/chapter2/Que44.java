    44. Which is the most common way to fill in the blank to implement
    this method?
       public class Penguin
    {
     private double beakLength;
     public static void setBeakLength(Penguin p, int b)
     {


            _____________________________


     }
    }

    A. p.beakLength = b;
    B. p['beakLength'] = b;
    C. p[beakLength] = b;
    D. None of the above

        44. A. Options B and C do not compile. In Java, braces are for arrays
        rather than instance variables. Option A is the correct answer. It
        uses dot notation to access the instance variable. It also shows
        that a private variable is accessible in the same class and that a
        narrower type is allowed to be assigned to a wider type.
