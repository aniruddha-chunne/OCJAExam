A. 56789
B. 11789
C. 11717
D. The code does not compile.

21. B. Remember that Java evaluates + from left to right. The first
two values are both numbers, so the + is evaluated as numeric
addition, resulting in a reduction to 11 + "7" + 8 + 9. The next
two terms, 11 + "7", are handled as string concatenation since
one of the terms is a String. This allows us to reduce the
expression to "117" + 8 + 9. Likewise, the final two terms are
each evaluated one at a time with the String on the left.
Therefore, the final value is 11789, making Option B the correct
answer.
