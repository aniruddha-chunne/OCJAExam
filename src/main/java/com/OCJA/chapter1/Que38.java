        38. What is required to define a valid Java class file?
        A. A class declaration
        B. A package statement
        C. At least one import statement
        D. The public modifier // A class may also be defined with package-level access in a file, making Option D an incorrect answer

        38. A. Option A is the only correct answer as a class definition is the
        only required component in a Java class file. Note that we said a
        Java class file here; Java also allows interfaces and enums to be
        defined in a file. A package statement and import statements are
        optional for declaring a class, making Options B and C incorrect.
        A class may also be defined with package-level access in a file,
        making Option D an incorrect answer
