 *  3. Which type of loop is guaranteed to have the body execute at least
 * once?
 * A. do-while loop
 * B. for (traditional)
 * C. for-each
 * D. while
 *
 * 3. A. A do-while loop checks the loop condition after execution of
 * the loop body. This ensures it always executes at least once, and
 * Option A is correct. Option B is incorrect because there are loops
 * you can write that do not ever enter the loop body, such as for
 * (int i=0;i<1;i++). Similarly, Option D is incorrect because a
 * while loop can be written where the initial loop condition is
 * false. Option C is incorrect because a for-each loop does not
 * enter the loop body when iterating over an empty list.
