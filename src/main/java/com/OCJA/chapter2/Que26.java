        26. Of the types double, int, long, and short, how many could fill in the
        blank to have this code output 0?
        static _______defaultValue;
         public static void main(String[] args) {
         System.out.println(defaultValue);
         }
        A. One
        B. Two
        C. Three
        D. Four

26. C. Since defaultValue is an instance variable, it is automatically
initialized to the corresponding value for that type. For double,
that value is 0.0. By contrast, it is 0 for int, long, and short.
Therefore Option C is correct.
