        21. What is the first line in the following code to not compile?
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
                 int Integer = 0; // k1
                 Integer int = 0; // k2
                 Integer ++; // k3
                 int++; // k4
        }
                A. k1
                B. k2
                C. k3
                D. k4

        21. B. Integer is the name of a class in Java. While it is bad practice
        to use the name of a class as your local variable name, this is
        legal. Therefore, k1 does compile. It is not legal to use a reserved
        word as a variable name. All of the primitives including int are
        reserved words. Therefore, k2 does not compile, and Option B is
        the answer. Line k4 doesnâ€™t compile either, but the question asks
        about the first line to not compile.
