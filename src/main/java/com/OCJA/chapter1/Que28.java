        28. Given the following class definition, what is the maximum
        number of import statements that can be discarded and still
        have the code compile? For this question, assume that the
        Blackhole class is defined only in the stars package.

        package planetarium;
        import java.lang.*;
        import stars.*;
        import java.lang.Object;
        import stars.Blackhole;

    public class Observer {
    public void find(Blackhole blackhole) {}
    }
        A. Zero
        B. One
        C. Two
        D. Three

        D. The import statements for stars.* and stars.Blackhole are
        redundant import statements, since only the class Blackhole is
        used, and therefore one of them can be safely removed. The
        import statements java.lang.* and java.lang.Object are both
        not required as java.lang is automatically imported in every
        Java class. Therefore, three of the four import statements can be
        safely removed, making the correct answer Option D.
