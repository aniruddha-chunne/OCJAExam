        24. Which of the following is not a property of a JVM?
        A. It prevents Java bytecode from being easily
        decoded/decompiled.
        B. It supports platform independence.
        C. It manages memory for the application.
        D. It translates Java instructions to machine instructions.

        24. A. Options B, C, and D are each correct statements about JVMs.
        Option A is incorrect. Not only is it not a statement about JVMs,
        it is actually false as Java bytecode can often be easily
        decoded/decompiled.
