//524 - Answer

        19. Which of the following is true of a Java bytecode file?
        A. It can be run on any computer with a compatible JVM.
        B. It can only be executed on the same type of computer that it
        was created on.
        C. It can be easily read and modified in a standard text editor.
        D. It requires the corresponding .java that created it to
        execute.


        A. A Java bytecode file is a binary encoded set of instructions
        designed to be run on any computer with a compatible JVM,
        making Option A the only correct answer. By compatible JVM,
        we mean one capable of running the class file. For example, a
        Java 6 JVM may have trouble executing a Java 8 compiled file.
        Option B is incorrect, and is more a facet of machine language
        compiled programming classes. Option C is also incorrect as
        binary data is not particularly human readable. Finally, Option
        D is incorrect as the compiled file can be distributed without its
        .java source file and execute without issue.
