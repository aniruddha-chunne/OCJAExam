    11. Which statement about import statements is true?
    A. The class will not compile if it contains unused import
    statements.

    B. Unused import statements can be removed from the class
    without causing a class to become unable to be compiled.

  *******  C. The class will not compile if a duplicate import statement is
    present.

    D. If a class contains an import statement for a class used in
    the program that cannot be found, it can still compile.

    11. B. A class will compile if it has unused or redundant import
    statements, making Option A and C incorrect. Option D is also
    incorrect as the compiler must be able to locate the class of the
    import statement. The correct answer is Option B. Removing
    unused import statements does not cause a class to become
    unable to be compiled.
