        38. How many of the following lines compile?
        int i = null;
        Integer in = null;
        String s = null;
        A. None
        B. One
        C. Two
        D. Three

        38. C. Objects are allowed to have a null reference while primitives
        cannot. int is a primitive, so assigning null to it does not
        compile. Integer and String are both objects and can therefore
        be assigned a null reference. Therefore, Option C is correct.
