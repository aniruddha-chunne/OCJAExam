 * 35. Which starts counting from one rather than zero?
 * A. Array indexes
 * B. The index used by charAt in a String
 * C. The months in a LocalDateTime
 * D. The months in a LocalTime
 *
 * 35. C. In Java, most things use zero-based indexes, including arrays
 * and a String. Months are an exception to this convention
 * starting Java 8. This makes the answer either Option C or D.
 * However, LocalTime does not contain date fields, so it has to be
 * Option C.
