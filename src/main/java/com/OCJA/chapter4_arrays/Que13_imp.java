        13. How many of the following are legal declarations?
        float[] lion = new float[];
        float[] tiger = new float[1];
        float[] bear = new[] float;
        float[] ohMy = new[1] float;
        A. None
        B. One
        C. Two
        D. Three

        13. B. Since no elements are being provided when creating the
        arrays, a size is required. Therefore, lion and bear are incorrect.
        The braces containing the size are required to be after the type,
        making ohMy incorrect. The only one that is correct is tiger,
        making the correct answer Option B.
