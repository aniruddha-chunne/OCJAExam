            8. Which of the following is a wrapper class?
            A. int
            B. Int
            C. Integer
            D. Object

            8. C. Option A is incorrect because int is a primitive. Option B is
            incorrect because it is not the name of a class in Java. While
            Option D is a class in Java, it is not a wrapper class because it
            does not map to a primitive. Therefore, Option C is correct.
