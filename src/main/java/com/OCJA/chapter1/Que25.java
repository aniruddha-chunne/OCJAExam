        25. Which of the following variables are always in scope for the
        entire program?
        A. Package variables
        B. Class variables
        C. Instance variables
        D. Local variables

        25. B. There is no such thing as package variables, so Option A is
        incorrect. Option C is incorrect as the variable is only in scope
        within a specific instance of the class. Option D is also incorrect
        as the variable is only in scope for a single method that it is
        defined in. Option B is the only correct answer as class variables
        are in scope within the program.
