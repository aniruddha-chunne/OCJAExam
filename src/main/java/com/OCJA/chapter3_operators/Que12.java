12. What is the output of the following application?
package restaurant;
public class Pieces {
 public static void main(String[] info) {
 int flair = 15;
 if(flair >= 15 && flair < 37) {
 System.out.print("Not enough");
 } if(flair==37) {
 System.out.print("Just right");
 } else {
 System.out.print("Too many");
 }
 }
}
A. Not enough
B. Just right
C. Too many
D. None of the above

12. D. For this question, it helps to notice that the second if-then
statement is not connected to the first if-then statement, as
there is no else joining them. When this code executes, the first
if-then statement outputs Not enough since flair is >= 15 and <
37. The second if-then statement is then evaluated. Since flair
is not 37, the expression Too many is outputted. Since two
statements are outputted, Option D, none of the above, is the
correct answer.
