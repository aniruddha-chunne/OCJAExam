    20. How many of the following are legal declarations?
    [][] String alpha;
    [] String beta;
    String[][] gamma;
    String[] delta[];
    String epsilon[][];
    A. Two
    B. Three
    C. Four
    D. Five

    20. B. As with a one-dimensional array, the braces must be after the
    type, making alpha and beta illegal declarations. For a multi-dimensional array, the braces are allowed to be before and/or
    after the variable name. They do not need to be in the same
    place. Therefore, the remaining three are correct, and Option B
    is correct.
