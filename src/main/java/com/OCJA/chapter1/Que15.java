        15. Which one of the following statements is true about using
        packages to organize your code in Java?
        A. Every class is required to include a package declaration.
        B. To create a new package, you need to add a package.init
        file to the directory.
        C. Packages allow you to limit access to classes, methods, or
        data from classes outside the package.
        D. It is not possible to restrict access to objects and methods
        within a package

        15. C. Classes may be defined without a package declaration and are
        placed in the default package, so Option A is incorrect. Option B
        is a completely false statement as no such file is required in
        Java. Option C is correct as it is one of the primary reasons for
        organizing your application into packages. Option D is incorrect
        as package-private allows access to methods and variables to be
        limited to those classes within the same package.
