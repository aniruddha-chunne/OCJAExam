        2. Fill in the blank in the following code to get the first element from the
        varargs parameter.
        public void toss (Frisbee... f) {
         Frisbee first = ____________;
        }
        A. f
        B. f[0]
        C. f[1]
        D. None of the above

        2. B. Array indexes are zero based in Java. A varargs parameter is
        simply another way of passing in data to a method. From within
        the method, it is treated just like you had written Frisbee[] f as
        the method parameter. Therefore, the first element uses the 0th
        index, and Option B is correct.
