        36. Which of the following method signatures is not a valid
        declaration of an entry point in a Java application?
        A. public static void main(String... arguments)
        B. public static void main(String arguments)
        C. public static final void main(String[] arguments)
        D. public static void main(String[] arguments)

        36. B. An entry point in a Java application consists of a main()
        method with a single String[] argument, return type of void,
        and modifiers public and static. Option D is the typical syntax
        for this method, although Options A and C are also valid forms
        of this method. Note that the modifier final is optional and may
        be added to the method signature. Furthermore, the main()
        method may take a vararg or array. Option B is the only invalid
        declaration as it does not take an array as an argument.
