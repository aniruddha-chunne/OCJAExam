25. What is the output of the following application?
package mode;
public class Transportation {
 public static String travel(int distance) {
 return distance<1000 ? "train" : 10;
 }
 public static void main(String[] answer) {
 System.out.print(travel(500));
 }
}
A. train
B. 10
C. The code does not compile.
D. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.

25. C. Ternary operations require both right-hand expressions to be
of compatible data types. In this example, the first right-hand
expression of the outer ternary operation is of type String, while
the second right-hand expression is of type int. Since these data
types are incompatible, the code does not compile, and Option C
is the correct answer.
