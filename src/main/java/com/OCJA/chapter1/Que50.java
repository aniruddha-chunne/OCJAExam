                //528 - Answer

                50. Which statement about the JVM is true?
                A. The JVM schedules garbage collection on a predictable
                schedule.
                B. The JVM ensures that the application will always terminate.
                C. The JVM requires a properly defined entry point method to
                execute the application.
                D. A Java compiled code can be run on any computer.

                50. C. Garbage collection can happen at any time while an
                application is running, especially if the available memory
                suddenly becomes low, making Option A incorrect. Option B is
                also incorrect, since it is trivial to create a Java application with
                an infinite loop that never terminates. Option D is incorrect
                because the computer must be able to run the JVM in order to
                execute a Java class. Option C is the only correct answer, as the
                JVM does require an entry point method to begin executing the
                application.
