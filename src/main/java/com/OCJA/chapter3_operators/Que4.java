4. What is the output of the following application?
package planning;
public class ThePlan {
 public static void main(String[] input) {
 int plan = 1;
 plan = plan++ + --plan;
 if(plan==1) {
 System.out.print("Plan A");
 } else { if(plan==2) System.out.print("Plan B");
 } else System.out.print("Plan C");
 }
}
A. Plan A
B. Plan B
C. Plan C
D. None of the above

4. D. This code does not compile because it has two else
statements as part of a single if-then statement. Notice that the
second if statement is not connected to the last else statement.
For this reason, Option D, none of the above, is the correct
answer.
