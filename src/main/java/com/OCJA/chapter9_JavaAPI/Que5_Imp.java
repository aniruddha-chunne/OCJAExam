 *
 * 5. How many of the types ArrayList, List, and Object can fill in the
 * blank to produce code that compiles?
 * List frisbees = new ____________();
 * A. None
 * B. One
 * C. Two
 * D. Three
 *
 * B
 *
 * 5. B. List is an interface and not a class. It cannot be instantiated.
 * While Object is a concrete class, it does not implement the List
 * interface so it cannot be assigned to frisbees. Note that if you
 * were to add an explicit cast, it would compile and throw an
 * exception at runtime. Of the three options, only ArrayList can
 * fill in the blank, so Option B is correct.
