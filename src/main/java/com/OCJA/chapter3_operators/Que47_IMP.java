47. What is the value of (5 + (!2 + 8) * 3 - 3 % 2)/2 in Java?
A. 2
B. 11
C. 16
D. None of the above

47. D. The question looks a lot more difficult than it is. In fact, to
solve it you don’t have to compute anything! You just have to
notice that the logical complement operator (!), which can only
be applied to boolean values, is being applied to a numeric value.
Therefore, the answer is that the expression wouldn’t compile or
run, making Option D the correct answer.
