 * 32. Which of the following is equivalent to this code snippet given an
 * array of String objects?
 * for (int i=fun.length-1; i>=0; i‐‐)
 *  System.out.println(fun[i]);
 * A. for (String f = fun) System.out.println(f);
 * B. for (String f : fun) System.out.println(f);
 * C. for (String f fun) System.out.println(it);
 * D. None of the above
 *
 * 32. D. Options A and C do not compile as they do not use the correct
 * syntax for a for-each loop. The for-each loop is only able to go
 * through an array in ascending order. It is not able to control the
 * order, making Option C incorrect. Therefore, Option D is the
 * answer.
