 *
 * 6. What keyword is used to proceed with execution immediately
 * after a loop?
 * A. break
 * B. continue
 * C. end
 * D. skip
 *
 * 6. A. The break keyword is used to end the loop iteration
 * immediately, skip any remaining executions of the loop, and
 * resume execution immediately after the loop. Therefore, Option
 * A is correct. Option B is incorrect because execution proceeds at
 * the next execution of the current loop for continue. Options C
 * and D are incorrect because these are not keywords in Java.
