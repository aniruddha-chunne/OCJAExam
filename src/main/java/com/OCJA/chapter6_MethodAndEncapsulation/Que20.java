 * 20. Given a method with one of the following return types, which
 * data type prevents the return statement from being used within
 * the method?
 * A. byte
 * B. String
 * C. void
 * D. None of the above
 *
 *20. D. Options A and B are incorrect because a method with a nonvoid return type requires that the method return a value using
 * the return statement. Option C is also incorrect since a method
 * with a void return type can still call the return command with no
 * values and exit the method. Therefore, Option D is the correct
 * answer.
