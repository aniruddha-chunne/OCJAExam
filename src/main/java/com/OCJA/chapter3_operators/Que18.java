18. Given the following code snippet, assuming dayOfWeek is an int,
what variable type of saturday is not permitted?
final _________ saturday = 6;
switch(dayOfWeek) {
 default:
 System.out.print("Another Weekday");
 break;
 case saturday:
 System.out.print("Weekend!");
}
A. byte
B. long
C. int
D. None of the above

18. B. Any value that can be implicitly promoted to int will work for
the case statement with an int input. Since switch statements do
not support long values, and long cannot be converted to int
without a possible loss of data, Option B is the correct answer.
