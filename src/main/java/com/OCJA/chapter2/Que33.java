        33. Which statement is true about primitives?
        A. Primitive types begin with a lowercase letter.
        B. Primitive types can be set to null.
        C. String is a primitive.

        33. A. An example of a primitive type is int. All the primitive types
        are lowercase, making Option A correct. Unlike object reference
        variables, primitives cannot reference null. String is not a
        primitive as evidenced by the uppercase letter in the name and
        the fact that we can call methods on it. You can create your own
        classes, but not primitives.
