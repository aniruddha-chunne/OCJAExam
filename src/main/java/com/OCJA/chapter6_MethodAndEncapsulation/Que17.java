/**
 * 131 - MethodAndEncapsulation
 * 565 - Answer
 *
 * 17. Which of the following is not a reason to use encapsulation when
 * designing a class?
 * A. Promote usability by other developers.
 * B. Maintain class data integrity of data elements.
 * C. Prevent users from modifying the internal attributes of a
 * class.
 * D. Increase concurrency and improve performance.
 *
 * 17. D. Implementing encapsulation prevents internal attributes of a
 * class from being modified directly, so Option C is a true
 * statement. By preventing access to internal attributes, we can
 * also maintain class data integrity between elements, making
 * Option B a true statement. Option A is also a true statement
 * about encapsulation, since well-encapsulated classes are often
 * easier to use. Option D is an incorrect statement. Encapsulation
 * makes no guarantees about performance and concurrency.
