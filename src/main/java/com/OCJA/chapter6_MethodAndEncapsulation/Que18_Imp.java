 * 18. Which of the following data types can be modified after they are
 * passed to a method as an argument?
 * A. int[]
 * B. String
 * C. long
 * D. boolean
 *
 * 18. A. Option B is incorrect because String values are immutable
 * and cannot be modified. Options C and D are also incorrect
 * since variables are passed by value, not reference, in Java.
 * Option A is the correct answer. The contents of an array can be
 * modified when passed to a method, since a copy of the reference
 * to the object is passed. For example, the method can change the
 * first element of a non-empty array
