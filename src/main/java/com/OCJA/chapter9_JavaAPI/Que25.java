 *
 * 25. Which statement is true about the following figure while
 * ensuring the code continues to compile?
 * A. <> can be inserted at position P without making any other
 * changes.
 * B. <> can be inserted at position Q without making any other
 * changes.
 * C. <> can be inserted at both positions P and Q.
 * D. None of the above.
 *
 * 25. B. The <> is known as the diamond operator. Here, it works as a
 * shortcut to avoid repeating the generic type twice for the same
 * declaration. On the right side of the expression, this is a handy
 * shortcut. Java still needs the type on the left side so there is
 * something to infer. In the figure, position P is the left side and
 * position Q is the right side. Therefore, Option B is correct.
