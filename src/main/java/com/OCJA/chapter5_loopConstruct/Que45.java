 * 45. Which of the following best describes the flow of execution in this
 * for loop if the loop body is run exactly once?
 * for (alpha; beta; gamma) {
 *  delta;
 * }
 * A. alpha, delta, gamma, beta
 * B. alpha, beta, delta, gamma, beta
 * C. alpha, delta, gamma, alpha, beta
 * D. alpha, beta, delta, gamma, alpha, bet
 *
 * 45. B. The initializer, which is alpha, runs first. Then Java checks
 * the condition, which is beta, to see if loop execution should start.
 * Then the loop body, which is delta, runs. After the loop
 * execution, the updater, which is gamma, runs. Then the loop
 * condition, which is beta, is checked again. Therefore, Option B is
 * correct.
