41. What does the following output?
String[] os = new String[] { "Mac", "Linux", "Windows" };
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(os, "Linux"));
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. The output is not define

41. D. Java requires having a sorted array before calling
binarySearch. Since the array is not sorted, the result is
undefined, and Option D is correct. It may happen that you get 1
as the result, but this behavior is not guaranteed. You need to
know for the exam that this is undefined even if you happen to
get the “right” answer.
