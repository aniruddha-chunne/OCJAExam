/**

 * 582 - Answer
 *
 * 49. Which of the following is the best reason for creating a default
 * interface method?
 * A. Allow interface methods to be inherited.
 * B. Add backward compatibility to existing interfaces.
 * C. Give an interface the ability to create concrete methods.
 * D. Allow an interface to define a method at the class level.
 *
 *
 * 49. B. The primary motivation for adding default interface methods
 * to Java was for backward compatibility. These methods allow
 * developers to update older classes with a newer version of an
 * interface without breaking functionality in the existing classes,
 * making Option B the correct answer. Option is A is nonsensical
 * and not the correct answer. Options C and D sound plausible,
 * but both could be accomplished with static interface methods
 * alone
