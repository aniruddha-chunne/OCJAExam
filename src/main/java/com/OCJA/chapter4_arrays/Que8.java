        8. How many lines does the following code output?
        String[] days = new String[] { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday",
         "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" };
        for (int i = 0; i < days.length; i++)
         System.out.println(days[i]);
        A. Six
        B. Seven
        C. The code does not compile.
        D. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.

        B. There is nothing wrong with this code. It correctly creates a
        seven-element array. The loop starts with index 0 and ends with
        index 6. Each line is correctly output. Therefore, Option B is
        correct.
