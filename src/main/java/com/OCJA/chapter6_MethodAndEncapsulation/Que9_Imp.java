 * 9. Fill in the blank: A ____________variable is always available
 * to all instances of the class.
 * A. public
 * B. local
 * C. static
 * D. instance
 *
 * 9. C. The only variables always available to all instances of the class
 * are those declared static; therefore, Option C is the correct
 * answer. Option A may seem correct, but public variables are
 * only available if a reference to the object is maintained among
 * all instances. Option B is incorrect because there is no local
 * keyword in Java. Option D is also incorrect because a private
 * instance variable is only accessible within the instance that
 * created it.
