 // 531 - Answer


            12. Which of the following lists of primitive types are presented in
            order from smallest to largest data type?
            A. byte, char, float, double
            B. byte, char, double, float
            C. char, byte, float, double
            D. char, double, float, bigint

            12. A. A byte is smaller than a char, making Option C incorrect.
            bigint is not a primitive, making Option D incorrect. A double
            uses twice as much memory as a float variable, therefore
            Option A is correct.
