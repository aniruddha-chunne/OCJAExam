 * 17. Fill in the blanks: Excluding default and static methods, a(n)
 * ____________can contain both abstract and concrete
 * methods, while a(n) ____________contains only abstract
 * methods.
 * A. concrete class, abstract class

 * C. interface, abstract class
 * D. abstract class, interface
 *
 * 17. D. An abstract class can contain both abstract and concrete
 * methods, while an interface can only contain abstract methods.
 * With Java 8, interfaces can now have static and default
 * methods, but the question specifically excludes them, making
 * Option D the correct answer. Note that concrete classes cannot
 * contain any abstract methods.
