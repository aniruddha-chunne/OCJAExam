 * 15. Which keywords are required with a try statement?
 * I. catch
 * II. finalize
 * III. finally
 * A. I only
 * B. II only
 * C. I or III, or both
 * D. None of these statements are required with a try statement.
 *
 * C
 *
 * 15. C. A try statement requires a catch or a finally block. Without
 * one of them, the code will not compile; therefore, Option D is
 * incorrect. A try statement can also be used with both a catch
 * and finally block, making Option C the correct answer. Note
 * that finalize is not a keyword, but a method inherited from
 * java.lang.Object.
