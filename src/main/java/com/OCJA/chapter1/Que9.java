    9. Which statement about a valid .java file is true?
    A. It can only contain one class declaration.
    B. It can contain one public class declaration and one public
        interface definition.
    C. It must define at least one public class.
    D. It may define at most one public class.

Ans: -

    9. D. A valid .java file may define any number of classes or
          interfaces but have at most one public class. It can also not
          define any public classes. For these reasons, Option A, B, and C
          are incorrect, leaving Option D as the only correct answer.
