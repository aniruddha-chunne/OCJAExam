        41. Given a class that uses the following import statements, which
        class would not be automatically accessible within the class
        without using its full package name?
        import dog.*;
        import dog.puppy.*;

        A. dog.puppy.female.KC
        B. dog.puppy.Georgette
        C. dog.Webby
        D. java.lang.Object

        41. A. Options B and C are accessible within the class as they are
        covered by the import statements. Option D is also fine as
        java.lang.Object is available without an explicit import. The
        only class not automatically accessible within the class without
        the full package name is dog.puppy.female.KC as the import
        statements do not include sub-packages; therefore, Option A is
        the correct answer.
