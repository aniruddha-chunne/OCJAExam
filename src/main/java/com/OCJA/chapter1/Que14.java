        14. Which of the following lines of code is not allowed as the first
        line of a Java class file?
        A. import widget.*;
        B. // Widget Manager
        C. package sprockets;
        D. int facilityNumber;


        14. D. A class can start with a comment, an optional package
        statement, or an import statement if there is no package
        statement. It cannot start with a variable definition, making
        Option D the correct answer.
