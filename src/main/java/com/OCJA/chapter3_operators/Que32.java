32. What is the value of 12 + 6 * 3 % (1 + 1) in Java?
A. 0
B. 12
C. 14
D. None of the above

32. B. The question is about operator precedence and order of
operation. The multiplication * and modulus % operators have
the highest precedence, although what is inside the parentheses
needs to be evaluated first. We can reduce the expression to the
following: 12 + 6 * 3 % 2. Since multiplication * and modulus %
have the same operator precedence, we evaluate them from left
to right as follows: 12 + 6 * 3 % 2 → 12 + 18 % 2 → 12 + 0 →
12. We see that despite all of the operators on the right-hand
side of the expression, the result is zero, leaving us a value of 12,
making Option B the correct answer.
