 * 2. Which type of loop is best known for using an index or counter?
 * A. do-while loop
 * B. for (traditional)

 * counting up or down as the loop progresses. Therefore, Option B
 * is correct. Options A and D are incorrect because do-while and
 * while loops are known for their boolean conditions. Option C is
 * incorrect because the for-each loop iterates through without an
 * index.
