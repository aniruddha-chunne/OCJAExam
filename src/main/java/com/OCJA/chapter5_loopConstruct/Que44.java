 * 44. Which of the following best describes the flow of execution in this
 * for loop if beta always returns false?
 * for (alpha; beta; gamma) {
 *  delta;
 * }
 * A. alpha
 * B. alpha, beta
 * C. alpha, beta, gamma
 * D. None of the above
 *
 * 44. B. The initializer, which is alpha, runs first. Then Java checks
 * the condition, which is beta, to see if loop execution should start.
 * Since beta returns false, the loop is never entered, and Option B
 * is correct.
