        18. What is the output of the following code snippet?
        String tree = "pine";
        int count = 0;
        if (tree.equals("pine")) {
        int height = 55;
        count = count + 1;
        }
        System.out.print(height + count);
        A. 1
        B. 55
        C. 56
        D. It does not compile.

        Ans: - D.

        18. D. The height variable is declared within the if-then statement
        block. Therefore, it cannot be referenced outside the if-then
        statement and the code does not compile.
