        23. How many lines does the following code output?
        String[] days = new String[] { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday",
         "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" };
        for (int i = 0; i < days.size(); i++)
         System.out.println(days[i]);
        A. Six
        B. Seven
        C. The code does not compile.
        D. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.

        23. C. The code days.size() would be correct if this was an
        ArrayList. Since it is an array, days.length is the correct code.
        Therefore, the code does not compile, and Option C is the
        answer.
