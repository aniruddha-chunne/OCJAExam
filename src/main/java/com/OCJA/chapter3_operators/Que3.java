3. What is the output of the following application?
package registration;
public class NameCheck {
 public static void main(String... data)
 {
 String john = "john";
 String jon = new String(john);
 System.out.print((john==jon)+" "+(john.equals(jon)));
 }
}
A. true true
B. true false
C. false true
D. false false

3. C. The first assignment creates a new String "john" object. The
second line explicitly uses the new keyword, meaning a new
String object is created. Since these objects are not the same, the
== test on them evaluates to false. The equals() test on them
returns true because the values they refer to are equivalent.
Therefore, the correct answer is C.
