 *
 * 25. Which of the following is a valid method name in Java?
 * A. Go_$Outside$2()
 * B. have-Fun()
 * C. new()
 * D. 9enjoyTheWeather()
 *
 * 25. A. Option A is correct since method names may include the
 * underscore _ character as well as the dollar $ symbol. Note that
 * there is no rule that requires a method start with a lowercase
 * character; it is just a practice adopted by the community. Option
 * B is incorrect because the hyphen - character may not be part of
 * a method name. Option C is incorrect since new is a reserved
 * word in Java. Finally, Option D is incorrect. A method name
 * must start with a letter, the dollar $ symbol, or an underscore _
 * character.
