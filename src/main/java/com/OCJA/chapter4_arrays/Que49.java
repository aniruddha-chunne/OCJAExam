    49. Which of these four array references can point to an array that is
    different from the others?
    A. int[][][][] nums1a, nums1b;
    B. int[][][] nums2a[], nums2b;
    C. int[][] nums3a[][], nums3b[][];
    D. int[] nums4a[][][], numbs4b[][][];

    B. All of the variables except nums2b point to a 4D array. Don’t
    create a 4D array; it’s confusing. The options show the braces
    can be before or after the variable in any combination. Option B
    is the answer because nums2b points to a 3D array. It only has
    three pairs of braces before the variable and none after. By
    comparison, nums2a has three pairs of braces before the variable
    and the fourth pair of braces after.
