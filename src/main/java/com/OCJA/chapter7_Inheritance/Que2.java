 *
 * 2. Which modifier can be applied to an abstract interface method?
 * A. protected
 * B. static
 * C. final
 * D. public
 *
 * D
 *
 * 2. D. All abstract interface methods are implicitly public, making
 * Option D the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because
 * protected conflicts with the implicit public modifier. Since
 * static methods must have a body and abstract methods cannot
 * have a body, Option B is incorrect. Finally, Option C is incorrect.
 * A method, whether it be in an interface or a class, cannot be
 * declared both final and abstract, as doing so would prevent it
 * from ever being implemented.
