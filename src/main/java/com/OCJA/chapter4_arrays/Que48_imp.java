48. Which of the following statements are true?
I. You can always change a method signature from call(String[]
arg) to call(String... arg) without causing a compiler error in
the calling code.
II. You can always change a method signature from call(String...
arg) to call(String[] arg) without causing a compiler error in
the existing code.
A. I
B. II
C. Both I and II
D. Neither I nor II

48. A. From within a method, an array parameter and a varargs
parameter are treated the same. From the caller, an array
parameter is more restrictive. Both types can receive an array.
However, only a varargs parameter is allowed to automatically
turn individual parameters into an array. Therefore, statement I
is correct and the answer is Option A.
