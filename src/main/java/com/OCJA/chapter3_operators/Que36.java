36. What statement about the ^ operator is correct?
A. If one of the operands of ^ is true, then the result is always
true.
B. There is a conditional form of the operator, denoted as ^^.
C. If both operands of ^ are true, the result is true.
D. The ^ operator can only be applied to boolean values.

36. D. The exclusive or (XOR) ^ operator requires evaluating both
operands to determine the result. For this reason, Options A and
B are incorrect. For Option B, you canâ€™t have a short-circuit
operation if both operands are always read, therefore ^^ does
not exist. Option C is an incorrect statement as the ^ operator
only returns true if exactly one operand is true. Finally, Option
D is correct as the ^ is only applied to boolean values in Java.
