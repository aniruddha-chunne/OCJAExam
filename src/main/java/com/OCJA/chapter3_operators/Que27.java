27. For a given non-null String myTestVariable, what is the
resulting value of executing the statement
myTestVariable.equals(null)?
A. true
B. false
C. The statement does not compile.
D. The statement compiles but will produce an exception when
used at runtime.

27. B. The statement compiles and runs without issue, making
Options C and D incorrect. Since we are given that
myTestVariable is not null, the statement will always evaluate to
false, making Option B the correct answer. Note that if
myTestVariable was null, then the code would still compile but
throw a NullPointerException calling equals() at runtime.
