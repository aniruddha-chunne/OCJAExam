            25. Which is correct about a local variable of type String?
            A. It defaults to an empty string.
            B. It defaults to null.
            C. It does not have a default value.
            D. It will not compile without initializing on the declaration line.

            25. C. Local variables do not have a default initialization value. If
            they are referenced before being set to a value, the code does not
            compile. Therefore, Option C is correct. If the variable was an
            instance variable, Option B would be correct. Option D is tricky.
            A local variable will compile without an initialization if it isnâ€™t
            referenced anywhere or it is assigned a value before it is
            referenced.
