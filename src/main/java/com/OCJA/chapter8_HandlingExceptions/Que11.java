/**
 * 172 - Exceptional_Handling
 * 585 - Answer
 *
 * 11. Which of the following exception types must be handled or
 * declared by the method in which they are thrown?
 * A. NullPointerException
 * B. Exception
 * C. RuntimeException
 * D. ArithmeticException
 *
 * B
 *
 * 11. B. NullPointerException and ArithmeticException both extend
 * RuntimeException, which are unchecked exceptions and not
 * required to be handled or declared in the method in which they
 * are thrown. On the other hand, Exception is a checked exception
 * and must be handled or declared by the method in which it is
 * thrown. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
