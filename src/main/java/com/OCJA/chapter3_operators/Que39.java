// 83 - operators
// 544 - Answer

39. Which two operators would be used to test if a number is equal
to or greater than 5.21 but strictly less than 8.1?
A. > and <=
B. >= and >
C. < and >=
D. < and >

39. C. The question is asking which operator represents greater than
or equal to and which operator is strictly less than. The >= and <
correspond to these operators, respectively. Therefore, Option C
is the correct answer. Note that the question does not specify
which order the operators needed to appear in, only to select the
two operators that match the question description.
