    16. Which line of code causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    String[][] matrix = new String[1][2];
    matrix[0][0] = "Don't think you are, know you are."; // m1
    matrix[0][1] = "I'm trying to free your mind Neo"; // m2
    matrix[1][0] = "Is all around you "; // m3
    matrix[1][1] = "Why oh why didn't I take the BLUE pill?"; // m4
    A. m1
    B. m2
    C. m3
    D. m4

    16. C. This code creates a two-dimensional array of size 1Ã—2. Lines
    m1 and m2 assign values to both elements in the outer array. Line
    m3 attempts to reference the second element of the outer array.
    Since there is no such position, it throws an exception, and
    Option C is correct.
