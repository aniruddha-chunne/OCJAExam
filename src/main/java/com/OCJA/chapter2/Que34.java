        34. How do you force garbage collection to occur at a certain point?
        A. Call System.forceGc()
        B. Call System.gc()
        C. Call System.requireGc()
        D. None of the above

        34. D. While you can suggest to the JVM that it might want to run a
        garbage collection cycle, the JVM is free to ignore your
        suggestion. Option B is how to make this suggestion. Since
        garbage collection is not guaranteed to run, Option D is correct.
