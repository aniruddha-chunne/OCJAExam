 * 5. What keyword is used to end the current loop iteration and
 * proceed execution with the next iteration of that loop?
 * A. break
 * B. continue
 * C. end
 * D. skip
 *
 *B. The continue keyword is used to end the loop iteration
 * immediately and resume execution at the next iteration.
 * Therefore, Option B is correct. Option A is incorrect because the
 * break statement causes execution to proceed after the loop body.
 * Options C and D are incorrect because these are not keywords in
 * Java.
