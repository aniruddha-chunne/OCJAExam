46. What is the output of the following when run as java Count "1 2"?
public class Count {
 public static void main(String target[]) {
 System.out.println(target.length);
 }
}
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. The code does not compile.

46. B. The name of the program is Count, and there is only one
argument because double quotes are used around the value.
That argument is a String with three characters: 1, a space, and
2. Therefore, the program outputs 1, and Option B is correct.
