        13. Which statements about Java are true?
        I. The java command can execute .java and .class files.
        II. Java is not object oriented.
        III. The javac command compiles directly into native machine
        code.
        A. I only
        B. III only
        C. II and III
        D. None are true.


13. D. The java command can only execute compiled .class files, so
I is false. Java is most certainly object oriented, one of the key
design principles, so II is also false. The javac command
compiles into bytecode, which must be run in a Java virtual
machine (JVM), and is not native machine code, so III is false as
well. Since none of the statements are true, Option D is the
correct answer.
