10. What is the output of the following application?
package dinosaur;
public class Park {
 public final static void main(String... arguments) {
 int pterodactyl = 6;
 long triceratops = 3;
 if(pterodactyl % 3 >= 1)
 triceratops++;
 triceratops--;
 System.out.print(triceratops);
 }
}
A. 2
B. 3
C. 4
D. The code does not compile.

10. A. The first step is to determine whether or not the if-then
statement’s expression is executed. The expression 6 % 3
evaluates to 0, since there is no remainder, and since 0 >= 1 is
false, the expression triceratops++ is not called. Notice there
are no brackets {} in the if-then statement. Despite the
triceratops–– line being indented, it is not part of the if-then
statement. Recall that Java does not use indentation to
determine the beginning or end of a statement. Therefore,
triceratops–– is always executed, resulting in a value of 2 for
triceratops and making Option A the correct answer.
