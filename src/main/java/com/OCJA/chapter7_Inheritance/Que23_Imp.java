 * 23. Which of the following modifiers can be applied to an abstract
 * method?
 * A. final
 * B. private
 * C. default
 * D. protected

 23. D. An abstract method cannot include the final or private
 method. If a class contained either of these modifiers, then no
 concrete subclass would ever be able to override them with an
 implementation. For these reasons, Options A and B are
 incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because the default
 keyword applies to concrete interface methods, not abstract
 methods. Finally, Option D is correct. The protected, package private, and public access modifiers can each be applied to
 abstract methods.
