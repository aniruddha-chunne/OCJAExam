            40. What is the result of the following when called as java
            counting.Binary?
            package counting;
            import java.util.*;
            public class Binary {
             public static void main(String... args) {
             Arrays.sort(args);
             System.out.println(Arrays.toString(args));
             }
            }
            A. null
            B. []
            C. The code does not compile.
            D. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.

            40. B. Since no arguments are passed from the command line, this
            creates an empty array. Sorting an empty array is valid and
            results in an empty array. Therefore, Option B is correct.
