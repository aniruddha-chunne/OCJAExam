26. Fill in the blanks: Given two non-null String objects with
reference names apples______________ and oranges, if
apples oranges evaluates to true, then
apples______________ oranges must also evaluate to true.
A. ==, equals()
B. !=, equals()
C. equals(), ==
D. equals(), =!

26. A. For this question, remember that if two String objects
evaluate to true using ==, then they are the same object. If they
are the same String object, equals() will trivially return true.
Option A correctly reflects this principle. Option B is incorrect as
two String objects that are not the same may still be equivalent
in terms of equals(). For example, apples == new
String(apples) evaluates to false, but equals() will evaluate to
true on these String objects. Likewise, Options C and D are also
incorrect because two String objects that are equivalent in terms
of equals() may be different objects.
