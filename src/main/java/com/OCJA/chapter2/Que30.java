        30. Which of the following correctly assigns animal to both variables?
        I. String cat = "animal", dog = "animal";
        II. String cat = "animal"; dog = "animal";
        III. String cat, dog = "animal";
        IV. String cat, String dog = "animal";
        A. I
        B. I, II
        C. I, III
        D. I, II, III, I


        30. A. Option A (I) correctly assigns the value to both variables. II
        does not compile as dog does not have a type. Notice the
        semicolon in that line, which starts a new statement. III
        compiles but only assigns the value to dog since a declaration
        only assigns to one variable rather than everything in the
        declaration. IV does not compile because the type should only be
        specified once per declaration.
