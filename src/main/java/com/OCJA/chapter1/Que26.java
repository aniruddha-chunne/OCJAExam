        26. Given the following wildcard import statements, which class
        would be included in the import?
        import television.actor.*;
        import movie.director.*;
        A. television.actor.recurring.Marie
        B. movie.directors.John
        C. television.actor.Package
        D. movie.NewRelease

        26. C. Option A is incorrect as the sub-package recurring is not
        included by the import statements. Option B is also incorrect as
        it uses the plural directors instead of the singular director used
        in the import statements. Option D is incorrect as the wildcard is
        applied to the sub-package movie.director, not the package
        movie. Finally, Option C is correct as it is a valid class accessible
        from the wildcard import.
