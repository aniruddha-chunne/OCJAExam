33. What is the output of the following application?
public class Airplane {
    static int start = 2;
    final int end;
    public Airplane(int x) {
        x = 4;
        end = x;
    }
    public void fly(int distance) {
        System.out.print(end-start+" ");
        System.out.print(distance);
    }
    public static void main(String... start) {
        new Airplane(10).fly(5);
    }
}
        A. 2 5
        B. 8 5
        C. 6 5
        D. The code does not compile.

        33. A. The code compiles so Option D is incorrect. The input to the
        constructor is ignored, making the assignment of end to be 4.
        Since start is 2, the subtraction of 4 by 2 results in the
        application printing 2, followed by 5, making Option A the
        correct answer.
