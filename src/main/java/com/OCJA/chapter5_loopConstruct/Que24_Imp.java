 * 24. Using the diagram in the previous question, how many of these
 * statements can be inserted after the println to have the code flow
 * follow the arrow in the diagram?
 * continue;
 * continue letters;
 * continue numbers;
 * A. None
 * B. One
 * C. Two
 * D. Three
 *
 * 24. B. In this figure, we want to end the inner loop and resume
 * execution at the letters label. The continue letters; statement
 * does that. The other two statements resume execution at the
 * inner loop. Therefore, only the second statement correctly
 * matches the diagram, and Option B is correct.
