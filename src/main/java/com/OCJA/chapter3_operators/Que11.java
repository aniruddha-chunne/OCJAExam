11. Which statement about if-then statements is true?
A. An if-then statement is required to have an else statement.
B. If the boolean test of an if-then statement evaluates to false,
then the target clause of the if-then statement will still be
evaluated.
C. An if-then statement is required to cast an object.
D. An if-then statement can execute a single statement or a
block {}.

D. For this question, it helps to notice that the second if-then
statement is not connected to the first if-then statement, as
there is no else joining them. When this code executes, the first
if-then statement outputs Not enough since flair is >= 15 and <
37. The second if-then statement is then evaluated. Since flair
is not 37, the expression Too many is outputted. Since two
statements are outputted, Option D, none of the above, is the
correct answer.
