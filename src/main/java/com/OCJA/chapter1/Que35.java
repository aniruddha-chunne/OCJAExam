        35. Which of the following is a valid code comment in Java?
        A. //////// Walk my dog
        B. #! Go team!
        C. / Process fails at runtime /
        D. None of the above.

        35. A. The double slash (//) syntax can have any number of slashes
        as a comment, so long as it starts with two of them, making
        Option A the correct answer. The (#) is not a comment character
        in Java, regardless of whether it is followed by a (!), so Option B
        is incorrect. Option C is incorrect as a single slash (/) is not a
        valid comment in Java. Finally, Option D is incorrect as Option
        A is a valid comment.
