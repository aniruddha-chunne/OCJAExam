17. What is the output of the following application?
package jungle;
public class TheBigRace {
 public static void main(String[] in) {
 int tiger = 2;
 short lion = 3;
 long winner = lion+2*(tiger + lion);
 System.out.print(winner);
 }
}
A. 11
B. 13
C. 25
D. None of the above

17. B. For this problem, it helps to recognize that parentheses take
precedence over the operations outside the parentheses. Once
we replace the variables with values, the expression becomes:
3+2*(2+3). We then calculate the value inside the parentheses to
get 3+2*5. Since the multiplication operator has higher
precedence than addition, we evaluate it first, resulting in 3+10 =
13, making Option B the correct answer
