        45. How many lines does the following code output?
        String[] days = new String[] { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday",
         "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" };
        for (int i = 1; i < days.length; i++)
         System.out.println(days[i]);
        A. Six
        B. Seven
        C. The code does not compile.
        D. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime

45. A. In Java, arrays are indexed starting with 0. While it is
unusual for the loop to start with 1, this does not cause an error.
It does cause the code to output six lines instead of seven since
the loop doesnâ€™t cover the first array element. Therefore, Option
A is correct.
