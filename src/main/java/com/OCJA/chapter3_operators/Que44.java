44. Given the following code snippet, what is the value of
movieRating after it is executed?
int characters = 5;
int story = 3;
double movieRating = characters <= 4 ? 3 : story>1 ? 2 : 1;
A. 2.0
B. 3.0
C. The code does not compile but would compile if
parentheses were added.
D. None of the above

44. A. While parentheses are recommended for ternary operations,
especially embedded ones, they are not required, so Option C is
incorrect.. The first ternary operation evaluates characters <= 4
as false, so the second ternary operation is executed. Since
story > 1 is true, the final value of movieRating is 2.0, making
Option A the correct answer
