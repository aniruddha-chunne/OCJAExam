 // 535 - Answer

    41. Which of the following lists of primitive numeric types is presented
    in order from smallest to largest data type?
    A. byte, short, int, long
    B. int, short, byte, long
    C. short, byte, int, long
    D. short, int, byte, long

    41. A. These four types represent nondecimal values. While you
    donâ€™t need to know the exact sizes, you do need to be able to
    order them from largest to smallest. A byte is smallest. A short
    comes next, followed by int and then long. Therefore, Option A
    is correct.
