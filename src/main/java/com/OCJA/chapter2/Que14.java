         14. Which of the following lines contains a compiler error?
        String title = "Weather"; // line x1
        int hot, double cold; // line x2
        System.out.println(hot + " " + title); // line x3
        A. x1
        B. x2
        C. x3
        D. None of the above

        14. B. Java does not allow multiple Java data types to be declared in
        the same declaration, making Option B the correct answer. If
        double was removed, both hot and cold would be the same type.
        Then the compiler error would be on x3 because of a reference to
        an uninitialized variable.
