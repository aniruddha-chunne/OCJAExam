                43. Give on the following class definition, what is the maximum
                number of import statements that can be discarded and still
                have the code compile? For this question, assume that the
                Broccoli class is in the food.vegetables package, and the Apple
                class is the food.fruit package.

                package food;
                import food.vegetables.*;
                import food.fruit.*;
                import java.util.Date;

                public class Grocery
                {

                        Apple a;
                        Broccoli b;
                        Date c;

                }

                A. 0
                B. 1
                C. 2
                D. 3


                43. A. All of the import statements in this class are required.
                Removing any of them would cause the class to not compile,
                making Option A the correct answer.
