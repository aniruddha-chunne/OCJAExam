            23. Which of the following is not a valid class declaration?
            A. class building {}
            B. class Cost$ {}
            C. class 5MainSt {}
            D. class _Outside {}

            23. C. Class names follow the same requirements as other
            identifiers. Underscores and dollar signs are allowed. Numbers
            are allowed, but not as the first character of an identifier.
            Therefore, Option C is correct. Note that class names begin with
            an uppercase letter by convention, but this is not a requirement.
