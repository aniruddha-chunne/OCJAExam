 * 10. C. First off, the return types of an overridden method must be
 * covariant. Next, it is true that the access modifier must be the
 * same or broader in the child method. Using a narrower access
 * modifier in the child class would not allow the code to compile.
 * Overridden methods must not throw any new or broader
 * checked exceptions than the method in the superclass. For these
 * reasons, Options A, B, and D are true statements. Option C is
 * the false statement. An overridden method is not required to
 * throw a checked exception defined in the parent class.
