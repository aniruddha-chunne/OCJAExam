 * 562 - Answer
 *
 * 5. Fill in the blank: Java uses ___________ to send data into a
 * method.
 * A. pass-by-null
 * B. pass-by-value
 * C. both pass-by-value and pass-by-reference
 * D. pass-by-reference
 *
 * 5. B. Java uses pass-by-value to copy primitives and references of
 * objects into a method. That means changes to the primitive
 * value or reference in the method are not carried to the calling
 * method. That said, the data within an object can change, just not
 * the original reference itself. Therefore, Option B is the correct
 * answer, and Options C and D are incorrect. Option A is not a
 * real term.
