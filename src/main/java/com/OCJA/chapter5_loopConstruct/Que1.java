 *
 * 1. Which type of loop is best known for its boolean condition that
 * controls entry to the loop?
 * A. do-while loop
 * B. for (traditional)
 * C. for-each
 * D. while
 *
 * 1. D. A while loop has a condition that returns a boolean that
 * controls the loop. It appears at the beginning and is checked
 * before entering the loop. Therefore, Option D is correct. A
 * traditional for loop also has a boolean condition that is checked
 * before entering the loop. However, it is best known for having a
 * counter variable, making Option B incorrect. Option A is
 * incorrect because the boolean condition on a do-while loop is at
 * the end of the loop. Option C is incorrect because there is no
 * condition as part of the loop construct.
