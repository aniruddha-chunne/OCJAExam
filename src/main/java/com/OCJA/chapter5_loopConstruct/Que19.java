/**
 * - loop_Construct
 * - Answer
 *
 * 19. How many of the loop types (while, do while, traditional for, and
 * enhanced for) allow you to write code that creates an infinite
 * loop?
 * A. One
 * B. Two
 * C. Three
 * D. Four
 *
 * 19. C. It is not possible to create an infinite loop using a for-each
 * because it simply loops through an array or ArrayList. The other
 * types allow infinite loops, such as, for example, do { }
 * while(true), for(;;) and while(true). Therefore, Option C is
 * correct. And yes, we know it is possible to create an infinite loop
 * with for-each by creating your own custom Iterable. This isnâ€™t
 * on the OCA or OCP exam though. If you think the answer is
 * Option D, this is a great reminder of what not to read into on the
 * real exam!
