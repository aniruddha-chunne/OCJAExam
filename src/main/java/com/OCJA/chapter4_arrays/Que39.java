    39. How many dimensions does the array reference moreBools allow?
    boolean[][] bools[], moreBools;
    A. One dimension
    B. Two dimensions
    C. Three dimensions
    D. None of the above

    39. B. This one is tricky since the array braces are split up. This
    means that bools is a 3D array reference. The braces both before
    and after the variable name count. For moreBools, it is only a 2D
    array reference because there are only two pairs of braces next
    to the type. In other words, boolean[][] applies to both
    variables. Then bools gets another dimension from the braces
    right after the variable name. However, moreBools stays at 2D,
    making Option B correct.
