2. What is the value of tip after executing the following code
snippet?
int meal = 5;
int tip = 2;
int total = meal + (meal>6 ? ++tip : ‐‐tip);
A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 6

2. A. Remember that in ternary expressions, only one of the two
right-most expressions are evaluated. Since meal>6 is false, ––
tip is evaluated and ++tip is skipped. The result is that tip is
changed from 2 to 1, making Option A the correct answer. The
value of total is 6, since the pre-increment operator was used on
tip, although you did not need to know this to solve the
question.
