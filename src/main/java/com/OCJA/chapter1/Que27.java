        27. Which is the correct order of statements for a Java class file?
        A. import statements, package statement, class declaration
        B. package statement, class declaration, import statement
        C. class declaration, import statements, package declaration
        D. package statement, import statements, class declaration


        27. D. Java classes are defined in this order: package statement,
        import statements, class declaration, making Option D the only
        correct answer. Note that not all of these statements are
        required. For example, a class may not have a package
        statement, but if it does, it must come first in the file.
