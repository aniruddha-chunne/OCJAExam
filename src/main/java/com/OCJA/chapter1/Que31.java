//525 - Answer

        31. Which of the following statements about Java is true?
        A. Java is a procedural programming language.
        B. Java allows method overloading.
        C. Java allows operator overloading.
        D. Java allows direct access to objects in memory.

        31. B. Java is object oriented, not procedural, so Option A is a false
        statement. Java allows method overloading in subclasses, so
        Option B is correct. Operator overloading is permitted in
        languages like C++, not Java, so Option C is also untrue. Finally,
        Option D is not a true statement as the JVM manages the
        location of objects in memory that can change and is transparent
        to the Java application.
