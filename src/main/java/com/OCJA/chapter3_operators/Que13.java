13. Which statement about case statements of a switch statement is
not true?
A. A case value can be final.
B. A case statement must be terminated with a break
statement.
C. A case value can be a literal expression.
D. A case value must match the data type of the switch
variable, or be able to be promoted to that type.

13. B. A case value must be a constant expression, such as a literal
or final variable, so Options A and C are true statements about
case values. A case statement may be terminated by a break
statement, but it is not required, making Option B the false
statement and correct answer. Option D is also a true statement
about case values.
