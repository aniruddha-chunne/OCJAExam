48. Given the following truth table, the boolean variables w and z,
and the expression w || z, what are the missing values in the
truth table, starting with the first row?
                    w = true            w = false
z = true            true
z = false                               false
A. false and false
B. true and false
C. true and true
D. false and true

48. C. The disjunctive logical || operator evaluates to true if either
operand is true. Another way to look at it is that it only evaluates
to false if both operands are false. Therefore, the missing
values are both true, making Option C the correct answer.
