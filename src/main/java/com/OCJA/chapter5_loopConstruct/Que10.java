 *
 *10. Which type of loop has a boolean condition that is first checked
 * after a single iteration through the loop?
 * A. do-while loop
 * B. for (traditional)
 * C. for-each
 * D. while
 *
 *10. A. A do-while loop has a condition that returns a boolean at the
 * end of the loop. Therefore, Option A is correct. Option D is
 * incorrect because a while loop has this condition at the
 * beginning of the loop. A traditional for loop is best known for
 * having a loop variable, making Option B incorrect. Option C is
 * incorrect because there is no condition as part of the loop
 * construct.
