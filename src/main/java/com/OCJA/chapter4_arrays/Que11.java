        11. Which of the following references the first and last element in a non-empty array?
        A. trains[0] and trains[trains.length]
        B. trains[0] and trains[trains.length - 1]
        C. trains[1] and trains[trains.length]
        D. trains[1] and trains[trains.length - 1]

        11. B. Array indices start with 0, making Options C and D incorrect.
        The length attribute refers to the number of elements in an
        array. It is one past the last valid array index. Therefore, Option
        B is correct.
