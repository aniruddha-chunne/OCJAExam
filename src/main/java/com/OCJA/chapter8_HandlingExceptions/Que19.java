 * 19. Which import statement is required to be declared in order to
 * use the Exception, RuntimeException, and Throwable classes in an
 * application?
 * A. import java.exception.*;
 * B. import java.util.exception.*;
 * C. import java.lang.*;
 * D. None of the above
 *
 *  D
 *
 *  19. D. All three of those classes belong to the java.lang package, so
 * Option C seems like the correct answer. The Java compiler,
 * though, includes java.lang by default, so no import statement is
 * actually required to use those three classes, making Option D
 * the correct answer
