        34. What is one of the most important reasons that Java supports
        extending classes via inheritance?
        A. Inheritance requires that a class that extends another class
        be in the same package.
        B. The program must spend extra time/resources at runtime
        jumping through multiple layers of inheritance to
        determine precise methods and variables.
        C. Method signature changes in parent classes may break
        subclasses that use overloaded methods.
        D. Developers minimize duplicate code in new classes by
        sharing code in a common parent class.

        34. D. Option A is a false statement, while Options B and C are
        actually arguments against using inheritance. Option D is one of
        the most important reasons Java supports inheritance, to allow
        increased code reuse among classes.
