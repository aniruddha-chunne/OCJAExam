        4. How many of the following are legal declarations?
        []double lion;
        double[] tiger;
        double bear[];
        A. None
        B. One
        C. Two
        D. Three

        4. C. The array braces are allowed to appear before or after the
        variable name, making the tiger and bear declarations correct.
        The braces are not allowed to appear before the type making the
        lion declaration incorrect. Therefore, Option C is correct.
